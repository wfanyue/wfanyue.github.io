I am an **incoming** Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore(NUS), under the supervision of [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/), and I am also currently a researcher at Meituan Inc., working with [Dr. Lin Ma](https://forestlinma.com/) on Multimodal Representation Pretraining.

My research focuses on multimodal learning, including Video Understanding, Text-to-Image Generation, and *etc*.

If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me at: wfanyue@gmail.com.
